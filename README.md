## Results
We evaluate our method on MUSDB18 and ESC-50 dataset with few-shot settings and full training data. Average SDR scores of APT and average prompt embedding without tuning (Baseline) list in the following table.
|         |MUSDB18-full|ESC-50-full|ESC-50-1shot|ESC-50-5shot|ESC-50-10shot|
|  -----  |   -----    |    -----  |    -----   |    -----   |     -----  |
|   APT   |   4.98     |    8.50   |    4.57    |    6.68    |     7.59    |
|Baseline |   4.31     |    6.44   |    4.09    |    5.59    |     6.10    |
Detailed results on ESC-50 are available [here](https://github.com/redrabbit94/APT-USS/blob/main/Results-ESC50.csv).
